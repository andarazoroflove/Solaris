Things I've Learned about Solarisâ„¢

Trials, Tribulations, and Packages...

This is a blog I had in 2006ish where I would write about things as I figured
them out on Solaris 5.6-10.x on SPARC hardware and x86 (toward the end).

I'm lovingly recreating the blog in raw HTML, you can see it here:

The orig.tar.gz file is the un-modified data from the original blog as 
archived in 2007. It was FuzzyMonkey My Blog 1.5, a complete flat-file
CGI script based blog. Unfortunately I don't have the cgi-bin side of 
the blog (old-blog-1.5.tar.gz) and FuzzyMonkey.net (though it works)
is not serving files. I was able to find 1.6x in the Wayback Machine
but it was re-written in to SQL so darn. If anyone comes across the 
1.5 version, I'd love to see this blog the way it was back then, again.
